# Flask Login Application

This Flask application demonstrates user registration and login functionality with basic validation. It uses a CSV file to store user data and provides a simple web interface styled with Bootstrap.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register with an email and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in using their registered email and password.
- **Validation**: Checks for empty fields, valid email format, and password length.
- **CSV Storage**: User data is stored in a CSV file (`user_data.csv`).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-flask-app.git
   cd your-flask-app
````

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation and additional packages. It helps to manage dependencies for your project without affecting the global Python environment.
   To create a virtual environment, run:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Here, `venv` is the name of the virtual environment directory. You can choose a different name if you prefer.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   Activating the virtual environment will allow you to use the installed packages in that environment. Depending on your operating system, the command to activate the virtual environment varies:

   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
     After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

4. **Install Dependencies**
   With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file. Run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, including Flask and any other packages required for the project.

5. **Run the Application**
   Finally, run the Flask application with:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will start and be available at `http://127.0.0.1:7000/`.

## Usage

- **Home Page**: Accessible at `/` and displays a home page.
- **About Page**: Accessible at `/about` and displays information about the application.
- **Contact Page**: Accessible at `/contact` with contact information.
- **Register Page**: Accessible at `/register` for user registration.
- **Login Page**: Accessible at `/login` for user login.
- **Success Page**: Accessible at `/success` to show a success message after login.

## Validation Rules

- **Email**: Must be a valid email address.
- **Password**: Must be more than 8 characters.

## CSV File

The user data is stored in `user_data.csv`. The file is automatically created if it does not exist. The CSV file will have the following columns:

- `email`
- `password`

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing CSV File**: The CSV file is created automatically before handling any requests. Ensure you have the correct Flask version.
- **Validation Errors**: Check if you are using valid email addresses and passwords that meet the length requirement.
